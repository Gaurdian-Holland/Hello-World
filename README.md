# Hello-World
Testing. One. Two. Three.
There are more people alive today that have ever died in the past. Holland, here. Faithful, American, family and friend loving. There's a few more dreamers and pursuers of happiness left in this nation. My aim is to protect and serve them; while holding up the U.S. Consitution in my not so manicured banjo calloused hands.
